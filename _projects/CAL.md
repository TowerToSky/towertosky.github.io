# Abstract
Confusion is the core emotion in the learning process, affecting learners' engagement and cognitive load level and determining whether frustration and boredom occur. This work proposes and presents the CAL database - a database of EEG signals for Confusion Analysis in Learning. CAL is the first database for investigating learning emotion via physiological signals to our best knowledge. CAL has three contributions, 1. design a new stimuli experiment to improve induction efficiency and accuracy. 2. propose a subjective and objective joint labeling strategy to solve the noisy labels issue. 3. provide an available dataset with benchmark results based on conventional and end-to-end machine learning approaches. We encourage other researchers to use it for testing their proposed methods or tools for recognizing students' confused states in learning. Click here to know the details about the dataset.
